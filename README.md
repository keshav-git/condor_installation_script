Condor Installation script
==========================

This script will automate whole compiling and installation process of condor scattering simulator.
This was written to help my colleagues,
so that they just install ubuntu in WSL and run one script to do the work.

This script is written for specific users in mind.
It does not come under any warranty of any kind.
